Fragments?
In react, Components are return a single elements, if you want to return more than one elements there we use fragments.A common pattern in React is for a component to return multiple elements. `Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.`

Rendering List
Suppose, You have a list of items and you want to display them in react, Here we cant use the `for...in` or `for...of` here we use functional programming like map, filter or reduce

Conditional Rendering
In react, Suppose you want to display some values based on conditions or simply a variable inside a JSX(javascript XML) you have to use `{}`.
